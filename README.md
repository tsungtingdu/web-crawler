# README

This is a simple project (application) that helps me collect those data I want from a website, which save a lot of time for me. 

In this project, I learnt how to

* Use Nokogiri (gem) to collect data
* Use Mechanize (gem) to log in company's website
* Create a class to optimise the code
* Use begin/rescue to solve 404 issue
* Use byebug to find out what's happening in my project.
