# README

This is a simple project (application) that helps me collect those data I want from a website, which save a lot of time for me. 

There are three main files that I worked on in this project:

* app/controllers/pages_controller.rb
* app/presenter/unit_page_presenter.rb
* app/views/index.html.erb

In this project, I learnt how to

* use Nokogiri (gem) to collect data
* use Mechanize (gem) to log in company's website
* create a class to optimise the code
* use begin/rescue to solve 404 issue
* use byebug to find out what's happening in my project


Thanks Daniel and Wei-Liang's guiadance all the way.
